			<td>Remove lint from your dryer filter after every use </td>
			<td>A clogged filter and lint trap make your dryer less efficient, reduces the airflow needed to keep heat from building up in vents, and forces lint onto the heating coils. Also, never let your dryer run when you’re out of the house or when you’re asleep.</td>
		</tr>

			<td><img src="https://schaffhouser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Overloaded-Surge-Protector.jpg" height="200" width="230" class="img-thumbnail"></td>
			<td>Avoid using outlet extenders or plug-in power bars </td>
			<td>They can quickly overload an electrical circuit. Replace old, damaged or frayed appliance cords, and never force a three-pronged plug into a two-slot outlet or extension cord.</td>

			<td><img src="https://content.abt.com/media/learn/tips-how-to/images/grease-fire-on-stove.jpg" height="200" width="230" class="img-thumbnail"></td>
			<td>Store containers of cooking oil well away from the stove </td>
			<td>When cooking with oil, never leave the stove unattended. Never pour water on a grease fire or try to carry the pan outside; water splatters the grease and makes the fire bigger, and the pan will be much too hot to carry.</td>

			<td>Be sure to properly extinguish smoking materials.</td>
			<td>Smoking materials that are not properly extinguished can smoulder undetected for days before igniting a fire. Never discard smoking materials on the ground or in plant pots.</td>
